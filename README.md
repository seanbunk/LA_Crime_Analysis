In the "LA Crime Analysis 2010 - 2023" notebook, I conducted a thorough exploration of crime trends in Los Angeles over a thirteen-year period. Utilizing data from a comprehensive dataset, this analysis pinpointed the most common crime types—stolen vehicles, battery, and burglary from vehicles—as prevalent issues. Further, I delved into seasonal trends, examining how crime rates fluctuate throughout the year. This investigation revealed insightful patterns, indicating potential seasonal influences on criminal activity. Through adept data manipulation and visualization techniques, I demonstrated a strong capability to transform raw data into actionable insights.
